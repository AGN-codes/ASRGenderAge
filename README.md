# "ASRGenderAge": ASR Gooyesh internship project by Ali Garakani Nezhad
Code for a Telegram bot that will predict the gender and age of a sent voice message

- You need to put your telegram bot token in ABOT.py
- You need to put the absolute path to the project folder and files in AMODEL.py

For the bot to start working, run ABOT.py


- Important: Please note that this was a test (predecessor) project to the main project that I had at Asr Gooyesh Pardaz, and the resources and models used in this repository were in public domain which I have forgotten the sources of.
